This document contains information and decisions made when creating closed captions for the World War II Oral History Project.

Identifying Speakers
--------------------

When creating closed captions, our first action is to identify the speaker. To do this, we first look at the `metadata <https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/?iiif-content=https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/manifest/wwiioh/2243>`_
for the work and see if the interviewer(s) and interviewee are listed. If they all are identified, we use the speaker
names like they are found in the metadata. If they are not identified, use the role of the speaker (e.g. "Interviewer").
