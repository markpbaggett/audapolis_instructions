Audapolis Procedures
====================

About
-----

`Audapolis <https://github.com/audapolis/audapolis>`_ is a tool for automatically transcribing audio and text.
This document describes how we use Audapolis to generate webVTT files.

Getting Started
---------------

Once Audapolis is installed, you can import and transcribe an audio or video file. Since the preservation file may
sometimes be different from the intermediate file, always use the intermediate file for transcription.

Transcription Options
---------------------

When possible, if transcribing an English resource, always use the :code:`English - big` model.

If using another language, consult Mark Baggett for the best model to use.

Always set speaker separation to :code:`on`.

Procedures Before Producing a VTT
---------------------------------

Once the transcription is complete, there are several steps to take before creating a VTT file. These are described below.
